## Review

Any questions about previous content?

---

## Content

-   Injection
    -   SQLi
    -   SSTI
-   SSRF

---

## Injection

Injection attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious data that is then used to control program behaviour

## SQL

Structured Query Language

-   Language for querying databases
-   Implementations include:
    -   PostgreSQL
    -   MySQL
    -   SQLite
    -   SQL Server (Microsoft)

---

## SQL Statements

-   SELECT _ FROM _ ...
-   INSERT INTO \_ (COLn, ...) VALUES (VALn, ...)
-   UPDATE _ SET _ = \_ ...
-   DELETE FROM \_ ...
-   ... -- this is a comment
-   ... # this can also be a comment (sometimes)
    â€¦

---

## SQL Syntax

-   WHERE

    -   \> - greater than
    -   < - less than
    -   = - equal to
    -   <> - not equal to

-   LIKE
    -   % - wildcard
-   UNION
    ...

---

### More SQL Syntax

-   ORDER BY
-   GROUP BY
-   DISTINCT
-   LIMIT
-   OFFSET

## SQLi

what?

-   User input contains control characters that interfere with the SQL statement

Why?

-   Bad programmers - The user input is being trusted to be a valid format.

---

## SQLi

#### Code before injection

`SELECT a FROM b WHERE a = '$userInput'`

#### Code after injection

`                          vvvvvvvvvvvvv
SELECT a FROM b WHERE a = '' OR '1' = '1'
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^`

---

## SQLi

What can you do with SQLi?

-   Bypass logins
-   Leak data
-   Spoof a user
-   Modify data (don't try in 6443)

---

## SQLi

You should be asking:

-   How can we tell what implementation is being used?
-   How do we know what tables/columns exist?

---

## Fingerprinting

-   Different implementations will have different artifacts
    -   **MySQL**: Version()
    -   **SQLite**: sqlite_version()
    -   **SQL Server**: @@Version
-   Seem more [here](https://www.sqlinjection.net/database-fingerprinting/) and [here](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/examining-the-database)

---

## Schema Recon

-   what tables exist, what do they look like?

    **MySQL**: information*schema.[tables|columns]
    **SQLite**: sqlite*[master|schema]
    **SQL Server**: SHOW TABLES; DESCRIBE <table_name>

## SQLi Mitigation

-   Disable debug logging
    -   No error messages, maybe just a blank screen?
-   WAF - Web Application Firewalls
    -   Reject/strip malicious payloads
-   Parameterised Queries

---

## Beating Mitigations

-   Payload stripped? Embed dummies
-   Blank response? Side channel attacks
    -   Timing Attacks
    -   Out of Band Attacks i.e inbuilt functions (therefore fingerprint!)
-   Error-based extraction
-   Boolean-based extraction
-   Subqueries
    -   SELECT a,b FROM c WHERE d UNION SELECT (SELECT ...), 2

---

## Remember

-   The payloads can be complex
-   Reporting a vulnerability != extracting data
-   Big database? - COUNT or LIMIT + OFFSET it instead
-   No SQLmap or automated SQL enumeration/exploitation
-   Don't try to DROP any tables

---

## Other Injection

### SSTI

Server side template injection

-   Jinja Templates
-   php
-
